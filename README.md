# Square_Root
This is my attempt at learning more about how computers compute the square root, I will be testing algorthims of my own against python's math's function. The goal, however silly, is to create a faster square root algorithm then the one that comes pre-installed in python. While I am only a high school student I believe this will encourage me to learn more about math and various algortihms as well as encourage me to think outside the box and do lots of research.

In this repository python will be used, this is for two main reasons. Firstly, my experience of developing programs with python is faster than any other language I know. Secondly, Python is very easy to develop and read for anyone. As for the actual speed of the language, it is slow, but I am not testing the speed but rather the difference in speed between the two methods, for this reason a big computer is not required and nor is a language like c.
